1. Redundant Props Type Definition
Problem: The Props interface does not extend any base type, yet it is used for HTML <div> attributes.
Solution: Extend HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement> to inherit standard <div> properties.

2. Unused children Variable
Problem: The children prop is destructured but never used.
Solution: Remove it to avoid confusion and potential memory leaks.

3. Inefficient Placement of getPriority Function
Problem: getPriority is declared inside the component, causing it to be recreated on every render.
Solution: Move it outside the component to improve performance and reusability.

4. Refactoring sortedBalances Computation
Problem: Complex inline filtering and sorting logic reduce readability.
Solution: Extract helper functions (as shown in your earlier refactoring) to improve clarity.

5. Incorrect List Key Usage
Problem: Using array indices (index) as keys in list rendering.
Solution: Use unique identifiers, such as balance.currency, to prevent performance issues.

6. Type-Safety Issue with prices Object
Problem: balance.currency (a string) is used to index a numeric array (prices).
Solution: Ensure prices is an object with string keys.

7. Undefined Props and Parameters
Problem: classes is not defined in the props type; lhs and rhs are not defined in the function.
Solution: Define classes in the props type and properly declare lhs and rhs in the function.

8. Overly Complex getPriority Logic
Problem: Using a switch statement is not best practice for mapping priorities.
Solution: Replace the switch statement with an object lookup for better readability and maintainability.

9. Missing Dependencies in useMemo
Problem: getPriority is missing from the dependency array of useMemo for sortedBalances.
Solution: Add getPriority to the dependency array of useMemo to ensure correct memoization.

10. Importing and Exporting Components and Hooks
Problem: WalletPage is not exported, WalletRow is not imported, and useWalletBalances and usePrices are missing imports.
Solution: Ensure all components and hooks are correctly imported and exported.

11. Returning a Memoized Value
Problem: The row should be memoized using useMemo, and formattedBalances is redundant.
Solution: Move row inside useMemo and compute formattedBalances directly in WalletRow.
